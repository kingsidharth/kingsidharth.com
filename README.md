# KingSidharth.com

Shifting my *official* website - [KingSidharth.com](http://www.kingsidharth.com) - to GitHub and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

Keeping the source files open so others can learn - like I learned from His Awesomeness [Zac Holman's](https://github.com/holman/holman.github.com). Fork around, learn around.

## License

But not giving it an open source license because - hey my photos and many others things aren't open source. So all fair **use for learning & reference purposes** is good to go!

## Using

* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) - falling in love with it, honestly!
* [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com) for [Compass](http://compass-style.org/)
* [HAML](http://haml.info/)
* [GitHub](http://github.com) - thanks, awesomeness!
