    <h2>2003-2009</h2>
    <p> My entrepreneurial journey started with an events management company.
      Local school-kids were our customers, we organized activities &amp;
      workshops. I was 12 at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, at the age of 16, I'd revive the idea — organizing summer camps
      and 1-day workshops at local schools. We focused on teaching students
      vocational skills like—film making, public speaking, blogging, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      In senior school, I started an online magazine (theFriendz) focused on
      teens, which had 10,000 monthly active readers at its peak. Some side blogs
      on topics like Meditation, Films, etc.
    </p>
    <h2>2010-2012</h2>
    <p>
      I dropped out of college and worked with startups like
      <a href="https://cleartax.in" target="_blank">Cleartax</a>, L-pad (a startup
      incubator), etc. helping them with UX, design, and product.
    </p>
    <p>
      Worked on my startups like WebMutiny (UX design agency), ReadJitsu
      (selected for StartupChile), Besperk (hosted online forum), etc.
    </p>
    <h2>2012-Current</h2>
    <p>
      In 2012, I joined the Instamojo founding team to take care of UX &amp;
      Design.
