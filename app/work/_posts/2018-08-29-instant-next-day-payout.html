<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>
  Businesses use Instamojo to collect payments (among other things).
  The money collected via Instamojo takes <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tplus1.asp" alt="_blank">
  T+3 days</a> (3 business days) to reach their bank accounts (a Payout).
</p>

<p>This delay creates two problems:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Cash dries, up. Especially during bank holidays</li>
  <li>
    Affects Instamojo's brand & customer experince as many businesses feel that Instamojo is withholding their money
    (<a href="https://www.quora.com/Payment-Processing-How-different-is-nodal-account-different-from-current-savings-account-explain-in-detail-about-this-system-as-allowed-by-RBI-India"
    target="_blank">which is not true</a>).
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Insights</h2>
<p>Here's what we learned from our customers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Cash flow is a critical problem among MSME, who don't have access to a
    formal credit line from banks
  </li>
  <li>
    Cash is needed for inventory, salaries, and petty expenses
  </li>
  <li>
    NEFT doesn't work on holidays—most digital sales channel do
    not settle money on these days
  </li>
  <li>
    Customers were willing to pay a fee for the credit,
    as long as it was <em>predictable</em>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/manik-singla-8a9a0332/" target="_blank">
    Manik Singla
  </a>, the product manager, brought these insights to attention and
  proposed two solutions:
</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Instant Payout:</strong> Get money in bank 24x7 instantly for 1%</li>
  <li><strong>Next Day Payout:</strong> Get money in the bank the next day for 0.25% (works better for low-margin businesses)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>With our T+3 cycle, we send one Payout every working day (if the Payout is due)
the money is wired using NEFT.</p>

<p>Next Day Payout was to work only on working days, so it was just a matter
of flipping a switch:</p>

<div class="[ grid-x grix-margin-x ] text-center">
  <div class="[ cell small-12 ]">
    <p>
      <img width="60%" src="/assets/images/work/2018/ndp/next-day-payout-instamojo.png"
      alt="Next Day Payout is as easy as flipping a switch.">
    </p>
  </div>
</div>


<p>
  Instant Payout works 24x7, the money is wired using IMPS. To be "Instant" every
  payment would need to be paid out instantly. That's fine if you get 10 payments a day,
  but it could easily turn into a notification nightmare if you were receiving 1000 a minute.
</p>

<p>
  It made sense to batch-process transactions, but we ran into another problem—IMPS
  has a limit of INR 2,00,000 per transaction.
</p>

<p>We decided to make Instant Payout a choice (voluntary experience).</p>
<div class="[ grid-x grix-margin-x ] text-center">
  <div class="[ cell small-12 ]">
    <p>
      <img src="/assets/images/work/2018/ndp/instant-payout-android-instamojo.png">
      <span class="caption">
        <strong>Instant Payout</strong> experince is quick & easy.

      </span>
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This approach had other benefits:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    1% is a high amount to pay but allowing businesses to choose gives them more control
  </li>
  <li>
    Allows the fraud systems to flag and prevent suspicious transactions from
    becoming eligible for an Instant Payout
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p class="highlight">
  <span>We distributed over 1NR 100 million of credit via Next Day Payout and Instant
  Payout in just 60 days of launch.</span>

<h3>A habit building credit line</h3>

<p>
  At Instamojo, we always wanted to build a habit loop, but thanks to the T+3 cycle,
  the loop never worked:
</p>

  <div class="[ cell small-12 ]">

</div>

<p>Instant Payout fixed that:</p>

    <p><img width="90%" src="/assets/images/work/2018/instamojo-habit-loop-instant-payout.png"
      alt="Instant Payout completes the habit loop—customers get a cue when they receive a payment, click a button and receive money in their banks instantly."></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
  Customers love pressing the button and hearing their phone ring with a notification
  from their banks—your account has been credited!
