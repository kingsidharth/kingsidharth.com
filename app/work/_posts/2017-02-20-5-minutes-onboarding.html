<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>
  Businesses use Instamojo to solve a variety of problems from payments
  to cash-flow. Our customers range from seasonal artists, and freelancers to enterprises.
</p>

<p>The Onboarding needed to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Get a business of any size and complexity to sign up</li>
  <li>Gauge the user intent and offer the right product</li>
  <li>Gather relevant information to underwrite for using
the payment services and credit line</li>
</ol>

<h2>Insights</h2>

<p>A serious business is not intimidated by a long Onboarding flow.
We learned this from years of interaction with new and potential
customers and experiments.</p>
<p class="highlight">

    A serious business expects a serious onboarding.
  </span>
</p>

<p>
  Over the years, our machine-learning algorithms have improved, re-affirming
  the inputs that matter. This helps us decide what questions
  to ask a customer.
</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>We distilled our learnings into a user-experience framework.
There were 3 key framework challenges. The Onboarding needed to be:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Customisable: to address the nature & need of the business</li>
  <li>Collect enough data to be able to retarget lukewarm leads</li>
</ol>

<p>
  The resulting framework consists of dynamic steps. Each step asks
  the user for a specific category of information. Eg: <em>Business Type,
  Tax Details, Bank Details, KYC Document Upload, etc.</em>
</p>

  <div class="[ cell small-12 ]">

      alt="A sample rendering of onboarding user experience."
      >
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The system can decide to add or remove these steps on the fly.
Or change the way of the questions are framed:</p>

<div class="[ grid-x grix-margin-x ] text-center">
  <div class="[ cell small-12 ]">
    <p>
      <img src="/assets/images/work/onboarding/onboarding-copy-changes.png"
      alt="If youâ€™re onboarding as a business, should you give your PAN or company PAN?
      The onboarding framework takes care of the smallest details that matter to the customers."
      >
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
  A user may not get approved by the risk algorithms to use
  payments. They would see a very different flow as compared
  to the approved users.
</p>

<p>
  Once the user lands on the dashboard, our 'Onboarding Tasks'
  guides the users to the <strong>Critical Product Experience</strong>. Critical Product
  Experience is the ideal path the customer should take to get the
  most out of Instamojo and become an active user.
</p>

<div class="[ grid-x grix-margin-x ] text-center">
  <div class="[ cell small-12 ]">
    <p>
      <img src="/assets/images/work/onboarding/onboarding-tasks.png"
      alt="Onboarding tasks guide customers to activation and show different tasks to different types of users."
      >
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>By the time the user sees the tasks, we know enough to recommend
the best products.</p>

<div class="[ grid-x grix-margin-x ] text-center">
  <div class="[ cell small-12 ]">
    <p>
      <img src="/assets/images/work/onboarding/onboarding-product-promotion.png"
      alt="Onboarding tasks can show the perfect product to the customers."
      >
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>
  Our payment button is on the customer website before they
  even get a call from our competitors.
</p>

<p class="highlight">
  <span>
    Most users onboard within
    5 minutes, and in the next 50 minutes, they are active users of Instamojo.
  </span>
</p>

<div class="[ grid-x grix-margin-x ] text-center">
  <div class="[ cell small-12 ]">
    <p>
      <img src="/assets/images/work/onboarding/time-to-activation.png"
      alt="Most users complete onboarding and activated within 55 minutes."
      >
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>With Onboarding tasks, we reduced the time to "aha-moment"
from 7 days to 50-80 minutes.</p>
