<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>
  Back in 2013-14, when our organic user acquisition was growing,
  there was a mismatch in the customer expectations and what we were offering.
</p>

<p>Our customers were:

<ol>
  <li>
    Expecting us to bring them leads. According to them,
    Instamojo was a marketplace like Flipkart & Amazon
    (which wasn't the case, we were offering e-commerce & payment tools)</li>
  <li>
    Confused between the products we offered—which one was right for them?
  </li>
</ol>


<h2>Insights</h2>

<p>
  We turned to those customers who understood Instamojo.
</p>

<p>
  At that time, <em>Offers</em> was our primary product— merchants could create an <em>Offer</em>,
  share it with their customers or list it on their Online Store.
</p>

<p>
  Data analysis revealed that our most successful customers were:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Using these Offers like a simple link: with a title and amount</li>
  <li>Not using any other feature as much</li>
</ol>

<p>After talking to these customers, we learned that they:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Share <strong>links to collect payments</strong>. Everything else was optional.</li>
  <li>Use these <strong>links to close sales</strong> over WhatsApp, Calls, SMS, social media, etc.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>
  MSME's are diverse and their behaviours, requirements, and workflows are fragmented.
  The business (Instamojo) wanted to de-risk and offer a variety of products to
  address the problems.
</p>

<p>The alternative was:</p>
<p class="highlight">
  <span>
    Keep the experience simple and no B.S.
  </span>
</p>

<p>With our existing products, we were offering too many features. Our customers kept reminding us, "everything else is optional".</p>

<p class="highlight">
  <span>Customers were using <em>links</em> to collect <em>payments</em>.</span>
</p>

<p>
  The pain was payment collection when closing the sale and giving the customer
  a choice in payment instruments.
</p>

<p>The solution was <strong>Payment Links</strong>.</p>

<p>
  <strong>Payment Links</strong> are simple and quick. You just enter an amount and a purpose,
  and it's done! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QvMx2fzTQ5c" target="_blank">Watch Video</a>
</p>

<p>This clarity achieved from UX research changed how we think of our customers, and vice-versa.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>
  Customers loved Payment Links from day one.
  We had never seen this speed of adoption for any product before Payment Links:

    alt="A chart showing adoption of Payment Links. Within 30 days of the launch of Payment Links, most active users switched and some churned users reactivated."
    >
  </p>
</div>

<p class="highlight">
  <span>Within 80 days, over 30% of Instamojo's GMV was coming from Payment Links.</span>
</p>

<p>This is what our customers had to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    "I've been using Instamojo since your early days. [You] finally hit clarity, kudos to the team."
  </p>
  <p>
    "You had a paradigm shift!"
  </p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Long-term Cost Reduction</h3>
<p>
  Now when a business signs up on Instamojo they see the option to
  <strong>Create Payment Link</strong> upfront. The functional name of the product
  means we don't have to explain anything to the customer.
</p>
<p class="highlight">
  <span>Over 80% of new activations happen without high-touch sales.</span>
</p>

<h3>Product-Market Fit</h3>

<p>
  Payment Links aren't a technically challenging product. In fact, with an
  in-house engineering team, it'd take you less than a day to create this.
</p>

<p>
  However, in the MSME market, there is often lack of technical know-how and bandwidth. That's
  why Payment Links work well for MSMEs and fail in other markets.
