<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>Businesses deploy a stack of specialised departments to deliver the end result.
  <a href="/portfolio/payment-links-instamojo-product-market-fit/">Payment Links</a>,
  Instamojo's flagship product, solves the <strong>sales</strong> part of their stack.
  Millions of businesses use Payment Links to close sales on WhatsApp, SMS, websites, etc.
</p>

<p>Fast-growing businesses found it difficult to scale payment links. With
new processes and software, links would become a pain instead of a pain-killer.
Payment Links needed to solve more problems.</p>

<h2>Insights</h2>

<p>It wasn't about adding features. Talking to our customers we learned that it's important:</p>

<ol>
  <li>to allow their customers to calculate the price</li>
  <li>to look professional & trustworthy and give information before & after the payment</li>
  <li>to collect data with the payment, so other departments can begin their work.
  Eg: Shipping details, invoicing details, donor details, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>These things were critical for their entire business stack. <small>(<a target="_blank"

insights we gained from our user research</a>.)</small></p>

    alt="Smart Links solve critical problems for several departments of a growing business.">
  </p>
</div>


<p>Data showed us that the following type of businesses were likely to face
these problems:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Small businesses selling services to consumers</li>
  <li>Businesses selling products & services to businesses (B2B)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>
  It was a challenge to cover use cases and feature requests for a variety of industries.
  We made it as simple as we could:
</p>

<div class="[ grid-x grix-margin-x ] text-center">
  <div class="[ cell small-12 img--100cent ]">
    <p><img src="/assets/images/work/2018/smart-links-flow.png"
      alt="When creating Smart Links business critical features come first."></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Features that have an impact on the cash-flow come first when creating a Smart Link. For e.g.:
<em>businesses don't want to oversell inventory or run a discount for too long.</em>
</p>

<div class="[ grid-x grix-margin-x ] text-center">
  <div class="[ cell small-12 img--100cent ]">
    <p><img width="80%" src="/assets/images/work/2018/smart-links-first-step-business-critical.png"
      alt="When creating Smart Links, we hide variety of complex features in a simple flow"></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Everything else comes next and is optional.</p>

<h3>The smart in Smart Links</h3>

<p>
  Smart Links understand the pain you're trying to address.
  Consider <em>data collection</em>:
 </p>

<p>Using Smart Links, businesses can collect Shipping Address with the payment.
This is a critical feature if you sell & ship products.</p>

<div class="[ grid-x grix-margin-x ] text-center">
  <div class="[ cell small-12 img--100cent ]">
    <p><img src="/assets/images/work/2018/smart-links-buyer-flow.png" alt="Smart link payment experince"></p>
    <span class="caption">
      <strong>Smart Links</strong> optimize the payment experience to <strong>minimize drop-offs</strong>.
    </span>
  </div>
</div>

<p>They can also collect business details for invoicing. Their customers get an
option to add the shipping address, billing address, GSTN, and the company name
while making a payment. By clicking one checkbox.</p>

<p>This saves hours of manual work.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p class="highlight">
  <span>Within 60 days of launch, 5% of our active user base adopted Smart Links
with zero budget spent on marketing.</span>
</p>

<p>Smart Link users are the most engaged and are more likely to use our
value-added services.</p>

treatment to my special and loyal customers."</p>

<h3>A new market</h3>
<p>Many API users started using Smart Links. We didn't expect that because API
users could make these features within days. </p>

<p>After talking to them we realised they have a tech-team but no time
to solve these problems. They'd rather have a payments expert handle these problems
and focus on their core business.</p>

<p class="highlight">
  <span>
    Smart Links is an API alternative for small or non-tech businesses; it's an
    API companion for bigger and tech-enabled businesses.
  </span>
</p>

<div class="img--120cent">
  <p>
    <img src="/assets/images/work/2018/smart-link-market-segments.png"
    alt="Smart Links is an API companion for large businesses.
    It reduces cost by taking care of edge-cases and short-lived use cases.
    Smart Links is an API alternative for small businesses.
    It reduces cost because business can delay the cost of API integration for years.">
  </p>
</div>

<h3>A moat against margin erosion</h3>

<ol>
 <li>Payments is a low-margin business</li>
 <li>There are other market players (SaaS) solving these problems with standalone
products</li>
</ol>

<p>With Smart Links, businesses get these solutions practically for free.
All they pay is 2% + Rs. 3 per transaction.</p>

<p class="highlight">
  <span>
    While other payment players in the market resort to reducing rates to
    acquire users—we continue to have pricing power.
  </span>
</p>

<p>Instamojo's pay-as-you-use model works better for small businesses.</p>
