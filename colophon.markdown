## Website
* Website is built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) & hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com).
* If it weren't for [Jekyll Documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Source Code of @holman's website](https://github.com/holman/holman.github.com) I'd never be able to do this.
* Using [Compass](http://compass-lang.org/) version of [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com).
* [Source Code of this website](https://github.com/kingsidharth/kingsidharth.github.com) is on Github.

## Design
* The typeface is my all time favourite **Lucida Grande**.
* I don't really like colors on interfaces but that evil blue is #2BA6CB.
* Photographs are either clicked by me or are clicks of me. More on those later. 

## History
* Earlier version of the website used [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) & Thesis Theme Framework.
